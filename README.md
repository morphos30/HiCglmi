# HiCglmi: Uncovering direct and indirect molecular determinants of chromatin loops using a computational integrative approach

![alt text](https://github.com/morphos30/HiCglmi/blob/master/hicglmi.png)

**Overview**

We propose a generalized linear regression with higher-order interaction terms to assess the influences of genomic features such as DNA-binding proteins and functional elements on long-range contacts from Hi-C experiments.
